AI and computational neuroscientist Ehsan Adeli is pioneering the use of computer vision tools to detect early signs of cognitive decline in seniors. By analyzing residents' movements and behaviors using discreet cameras in their homes, the AI algorithm can flag concerning changes like excessive TV watching or unsteady walking. This innovative approach aims to revolutionize the early diagnosis of conditions like Alzheimer's, allowing for timely interventions and support. Adeli's work falls under the field of ambient intelligence, which leverages AI to interpret data from everyday environments. The ultimate goal is to enhance healthcare by augmenting human potential and improving quality of life, particularly for seniors at risk of cognitive decline.
